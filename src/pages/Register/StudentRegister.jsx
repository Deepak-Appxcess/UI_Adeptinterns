The file appears to be missing a closing curly brace `}` at the very end. Here's the fixed version with the missing closing brace added:

[Previous code remains exactly the same until the last line, then add:]

```jsx
};

export default StudentRegister;
```

The issue was that the component definition needed one more closing curly brace to properly close the `StudentRegister` component function. The rest of the file was syntactically correct.
